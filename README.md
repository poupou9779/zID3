#zID3
zID3 is a C implementation of the ID3 algorithm.
This algorithm was discovered and published by Ross Quinlan in "machine learning" in 1986.
It is a decision tree based on Shannon entropy.

Warning ! build_C45_tree is still bugged for now : the *sunny* branch is pointing on nowhere. Has to be fixed.

##TODO
* complete C4.5 algorithm
* debug build_C45_tree
